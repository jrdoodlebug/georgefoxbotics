Since the beginning, Charlie Chen, senior, has been a pillar of fss robitics. His biggest accomplishment has been coding Georgina's hardware in java. He brought his love for coding and engineering, and desire to share these passions, to his co-founding and leadership of the George Foxbotics family. Charlie's biggest accomplishment has been coding the software for Georgina. As a leader, he helps to give others "hands on experience", acts as a mentor, and makes people suffer through his bad puns.

Cambell Lee, senior, is both an athelete and an engineer. Cambell has been there since the beginning, co-founding Computer Science Club, which later became robotics, with Charlie. He was looking to transform CS Club into something more challenging and project based. Campbell loves the camraderie and group of people in robotics. He's a sucker for a "creative and collaborative environment", and is most proud of the way "we've built a team that compliments each others' skills". His biggest accomplishment with Georgina is her claw arm. 

In his opinion, 

- looking to transform the cs club into something more challenging, & project based
- cs club leaders decided to transform into robotics 
- biggest accomplishment: the way we've built a team that compliments each others skills
  - claw arm 
- loves: camraderie, group of people, creative & collaborative environment

# annalise 
Annalise Di Cicco, senior, is an irreplaceable part of George Foxbotics. While they may not be an engineering-oriented person, they bring to the team their people and marketing skills. She joined robotics because of her friends, but fell in love it nonetheless. They can always lighten the mood of our meetings, and we can always count on them to be real with us. Annalise worked to organize the Upper School Worm-Off and the Riff-Off. They are most proud of their social media content on fssgeorgefoxbotics.

# ethab
Ethan Gutstadt, junior, is a vital part of the George Foxbotics family. New to FSS, he brings with him his previous knowledge of steam, experience with robotics and engineering, and his contagious enthusiasm! The team can always count on him to 3D model anything, and eat all the snacks in the room. His favorite part about George Foxbotics is that it enables him to get hands-on and build things himself, rather than assemble pre built parts.

- you were interested in steam
- peer pressure
- nerd 
- biggest accomplishment
  - eat all the snacks
  - helped to build & worked on the claw
- loves making & designing things
- making it himself, not just assembling pre built parts 

# oren pipano 

Oren Pipano may only be a sophmore, but he's already proven himself as a passionate an integral part of the George Foxbotics family. A self-described STEM student, he has lots of experience with coding and engineering. Oren always knew he wanted to do with robotics, but the school  never offered it until now. His favorite parst of robotics are being able to work with people, have new experiences, and always learning new things. His biggest accomplishment is his wiring organization. Oren gravitates towards steam because he can make anything, "the only limit is [his] imagination". 

- stem student
- wanted to get involved in robotics
- always wanted to be a part of robotics, but school did not offer it until now
- favorite part: being able to work with people that know more than me, and being able to always learn something new 
- biggest accomplishment: wiring 
- why gravitate to stem: love the idea of being able to make whatever comes to mind, only limit is imagination

Luisa Levine is our fearless robotics founder and faculty advisor. She schedules our workshops and events, orders parts for us, and encourages us to think outside of the box to problem solve. Luisa decided to start a robotics team because she noticed many students who were self starters, loved to challenge themselves, and loved new experiences. She is proudest of how the students have taken charge, and overcome the various challenges that have arisen. She loves the camraderie, fun, and silly spirit that her students bring to the team. We can always count on Luisa to provide the music for our meetings.
